# UpdatableLabel

A helper object that can be connected to any element for updating its contents.

## Usage

For use in a CoffeeScript project you can use the `src/updatable-label.coffee` file;
otherwise, grab the `dist/updatable-label.js` file - include the file in your bundle
as you're used to or link to it directly using a `<script>` tag.
